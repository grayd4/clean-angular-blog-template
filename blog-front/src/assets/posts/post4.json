The script formats the data and send it over serial to a COM port.</p><p>From here the Arduino takes over. It accepts the serial data, parses it, and displays it on the integrated display. A potentiometer calibrates the display contrast to the user's preference. The device contains an RGB LED which cycles between various colors. If some performance value goes beyond an agreed upon value (e.g. RAM usage > 50%), the LED turns yellow or red.</p><p>I designed and printed the 3D-printed housing for the monitor myself.</p><p><a href='https://github.com/grayd4/Arduino-PC-Monitor'>Project Github</a></p>",
